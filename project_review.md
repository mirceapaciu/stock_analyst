Mircea's Stock Analyst project demonstrates strong technical execution and a clear understanding of how AI can streamline real-world investment workflows.

He successfully deployed the application on AWS for public access, which shows good DevOps awareness and the ability to build solutions beyond the local environment.

The UI is insightful, user-friendly, and makes it easy for users to navigate through complex financial information.

I’m also impressed by the integration of external data sources and the system’s ability to extract correct, real-time price data. These features greatly strengthen the reliability and usefulness of the application.

Project's documentation is thorough and well-organized, making your project easy to follow.

Additionally, his plan to extend the system by training predictive models using real-time sentiment data and multi-agent are a strong direction for future development.

A couple of suggestions for improvement:

    In the DCF evaluation section, I would suggest presenting key figures visually such as through charts or simple plots that would make the analysis more digestible for users who prefer visual summaries.

    There are a few instances of repeated queries that could be cached to reduce redundancy and improve system efficiency.
